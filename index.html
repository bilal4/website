    <h1>Need of Sheikh wasti Masjid</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-12 column">
    <p class="content1">
     Shaikh Wasti and near by vicinity are having around 150+Muslim families and 100+Muslim shops. <br>
    </p>
 <p class="content1">
  The Muslim population has witnessed good amount of growth in the recent times as this area is closest residential area to the HinjewadiIT park, which has presence from major IT firms like Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, Cognizant, TCS, KPIT, L&T, IBM, ATOS, to name a few.<br>

    </p>
    <p class="content1">
The existing nearest Masjid is Wakad’s Alamgir Masjid which is around 5kms from this area which suffices the current need of Masjid for all the Wakad and surrounding areas including Hinjewadi IT park.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="content1">
During Jumah, Ramadan and Eid the space of Alamgir’s Masjid is not sufficient to accommodate the people of all the surrounding areas which includes Hinjewadi IT park.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="content1">
There were earlier initiatives to construct Masjid near Hinjewadi IT park, however it did not materialize due to the Legal, political hurdles.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="content1">
The proposed land is one of the very few options available to realize a Masjid, considering the Legal/political challenges. Request your whole-hearted support.

        <h3>The Benifits</h3>
        <p>A hadith of Ibn Majah: 242, in which Abu Hurairah RA reported that "The Messenger of Allah peace be upon him said: one of the good deeds that will reach a believer after his death is a masjid that he built(during his lifetime); i.e. its Sawab e Jaariya to build or to contribute in building a Masjid; you will surely get benefits of that after your death also.
<br/>A hadith of Sahih: in which Umar bin Al-Khattab reported that “I heard the Messenger of Allah (saw) peace be upon him say: ‘Whoever builds a masjid in which the Name of Allah is mentioned, Allah will build a house for him in Paradise”.
<br/>Allah rewards as per niyah (intention) not on the basis of amount so you can contribute as much as possible with the intention of Sawab e Jariya.</p>
